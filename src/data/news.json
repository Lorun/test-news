    "content": "Campbell Soup Co. is divesting its international operations and fresh-food unit, falling short of expectations for a sale of the entire company. Despite pressure from activist investor Dan Loeb to find a buyer amid a three-year sales slump and a sliding stock price, the struggling packaged food maker will pursue a turnaround plan to ignite soup and snack growth in its key U.S. market, according to a statement Thursday. Campbell is also boosting its cost-cutting target as it tries to slim down. Shares fell as much as 6.2% in premarket trading. As of 9:40 a.m. Eastern time, they were down 2% at $39.19. The stock had lost 17% of its value this year through Wednesday. The company’s board, which has been reviewing operations since the abrupt departure of Chief Executive Denise Morrison in May, plans to use the proceeds from the sales of brands including Bolthouse Farms and Arnott’s, an Australian snack food company, to pay down debt. The businesses up for sale generated about $2.1 billion in net sales in fiscal 2018, according to the company. Loeb has criticized the board’s “abysmal oversight” and argued the company should find a strategic buyer. Third Point, the hedge fund he runs, started building up its stake in Campbell after Morrison’s departure. It said in a regulatory filing this month that it had partnered with fellow investor George Strawbridge to push for a sale of the company. They collectively hold about 8.4% of Campbell shares. Third Point declined to comment. Strawbridge didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment. The board remains open and committed to evaluating all strategic options to enhance value in the future, interim CEO Keith McLoughlin said."
